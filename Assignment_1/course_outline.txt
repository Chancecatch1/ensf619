"To make great products: Do machine learning like
the great engineer you are, not like the great machine
learning expert you aren’t."

-Google AI Lab
Developing and deploying ML systems are relatively fast and cheap,
but maintaining them over time is difficult and expensive.

Textual data in Software Project

Semi structured
Source of Data: specifications,
design and architecture documents,
test cases, test results, review results.

Un structured

Also: Team members now a days communicate via e-mails and chats, change requests, and commit
messages, which all are available electronically as text sources.
Finally, in a software project, especially in the context of product development, customer surveys and
product reviews

26

Participation (10%)
I track participation in every class.

Expectations:
- Active Engagement in Discussions

Thoughtful and relevant comments during class discussions, asking questions
that demonstrate a deep engagement with the material, and responding
constructively to the ideas of others. Remember, it's the quality of your
contributions that will be valued over quantity.
- Collaboration and Respect
Working effectively and respectfully with peers during group activities or
discussions. This also involves listening to others, considering different perspectives,
and contributing positively to the collaborative learning environment.
27

Textbook
There is no required textbook for this course. However, I will be sharing
the scholarly articles and content as and when needed.
You can refer to the following two books for additional material
• Wilson, Ben. Machine Learning Engineering in Action. Manning
Publications, 2022.
• Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach by Roger S.
Pressman

28

RESEARCH PROJECT
• Covers study of literature and doing some own (independent) work
• Developing an AI/ML-based tool/solution following SE fundamentals
• Group work is encouraged, but not mandatory
• Option to enhance research into joint publication (I shall be one of the co-authors in
on the papers stemming from this coursework)
• Inspiration for project themes (you can bring your project from your ongoing work
with your supervisor)
on
A. Begel, T. Zimmermann, “Analyze This! 145 Questions for Data Scientists in
Software Engineering”,
In: Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE
2014).

29

Course software
• For architecture diagrams, we recommend you use MS-Visio
(from onthehub)
• But you can use others, such as Dia, or …
• Document editor (any of the following)
- MS-word
- Or LateX (recommended)

• Presentations
• OpenOffice ppt
• Or MS PowerPoint

More specific details will be provided later.
All the documents should be submitted in PDF format in D2L
