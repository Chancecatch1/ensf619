Assignment 1: Machine Learning Coding Skills Refresher
Objec&ve: The aim of this assignment is to refresh your machine learning coding skills before
diving into more complex topics in the course. This assignment will cover fundamental
concepts and techniques commonly used in machine learning projects.
• A*er compleOon of this assignment, you should have set up Python development
environment on your systems or learn to uOlize online development setups such as
Google Colab.
• You should also set up the GitHub repository and push this assignment code to it
(opOonal but recommended)
Due date: 5th September 2024, 11.59 PM
Submission: D2L Assignment 1 folder (talk to your peers to understand how to submit if you
are working with D2L for the ﬁrst Ome)
Instruc&ons:
1. Setup: Set up your development environment with the required libraries (e.g., NumPy,
Pandas, Scikit-learn).
2. Data Prepara&on: Download any one dataset from D2L (they are free datasets from
Kaggle.com, you can choose any of your own dataset as well, just provide its details)
3. Data Explora&on: Conduct iniOal data exploraOon. Display basic staOsOcs, such as
mean, median, and standard deviaOon, and visualizaOons like histograms or sca^er
plots on the distribuOon based on classes and other useful ﬁelds/columns (Ask me
quesOons if you have at least 3 days before the due date)
4. Data Preprocessing: Perform preprocessing steps, including handling missing values
(ignoring incomplete samples, ﬁltering based on string length etc., encoding
categorical variables, and spli`ng the data into training and tesOng sets.
5. Model Building: Choose a basic machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression,
Decision Tree, or K-Nearest Neighbors) and build a model using the training data (you
can choose to perform simple supervised ML at this point)
6. Model Training: Train the chosen model using the training dataset, evaluate its
performance on the tesOng dataset.
7. Evalua&on: Calculate and print relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, mean squared error)
to assess the model's performance. Print the confusion matrix and classiﬁcaOon report
or any other appropriate metric based on the choice of ML method.
8. Hyperparameter Tuning (op&onal): Experiment with diﬀerent hyperparameters to
ﬁne-tune your model's performance. (re-do step 7 above)
9. Documenta&on: Provide clear and concise comments in your code to explain each step
and raOonale behind your decisions.
10. Submission: Submit your Python code ﬁle a summary of your ﬁndings and a reﬂecOon
on the assignment in the last cell of your Jupyter Notebook/python code ﬁle.
Note: This assignment will refresh your coding skills and understanding of core machine
learning concepts. Focus on implemenOng the basics accurately rather than pursuing complex
soluOons.

2

Correct implementaOon of data loading, exploraOon, preprocessing, model building,
and evaluaOon steps.
• Clear documentaOon of code.
• EﬀecOve use of libraries and techniques learned.
• Reasonable and jusOﬁed decisions during model selecOon (and hyperparameter
tuning if done).
This assignment will serve as a foundaOon for the more advanced machine learning topics we
will cover in this course. Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask for help if needed!
